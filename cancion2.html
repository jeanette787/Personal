<br>
(SUGA)<br>
It was good in the beginning<br>
Going up and down itself<br>
We become tired before we knew it<br>
Meaningless emotional exhaustion<br>
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game<br>
Now, I'm so sick of this<br>
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game<br>
We're both sick and tired of each other<br>
<p>
<br>
Was the small argument the beginning?<br>
The moment I became heavier than you<br>
Because there has never been parallel in the first place<br>
Maybe that's why we tried to reach the balance<br>
If it was love, and if this is what love means<br>
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves<br>
It seems we're both tired of each other and holding the same cards<br>
Well, then<br>
<p>
<br>
All right, a repeated seesaw game<br>
It's about time we put an end to it<br>
All right, a boring seesaw game<br>
Someone has to get off of this seesaw<br>
I can't, but<br>
<p>
<br>
Let's not look at each other who will get off first<br>
Let's not drag things out<br>
Let's follow our hearts<br>
Let's put an end to this<br>
A repeated seesaw game<br>
Let's stop it now<br>
<p>
<br>
People can be so crafty<br>
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone<br>
But neither of us want to be the bad guy<br>
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities, umm-umm<br>
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel<br>
Ay, although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted<br>
<p>
<br>
At first, we showed off who was heavier<br>
We bragged and smiled at each other<br>
Now we're trying measure who's heavier<br>
A competition between us<br>
That became a flame, igniting quarrels<br>
It'll only end if someone gets off right here<br>
Acting like we're for each other<br>
With words mixed with thorns<br>
Can't keep doing this, we need to make a decision<br>
<p>
<br>
If we didn't have feelings for each other<br>
If we didn't think of each other<br>
Would we have dragged it out like this?<br>
Now if we don't have any feelings left<br>
It's dangerous, dangerous on this seesaw<br>
Stop thinking about me<br>
<p>
<br>
All right, a repeated seesaw game<br>
It's about time we put an end to it<br>
All right, a boring seesaw game<br>
Someone has to get off of this seesaw<br>
I can't, but<br>
<p>
<br>
Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on<br>
Hol' up, hol' up, just like in the beginning when you weren't here<br>
Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on<br>
Hol' up, hol' up, I get off this seesaw you're not on<br>
<p>
<br>
